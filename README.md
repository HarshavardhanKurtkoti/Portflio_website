# Three.js Portfolio

## Overview

This project is a **Three.js-based portfolio** designed to showcase various 3D projects and visualizations. It serves as a digital exhibition of my skills in 3D modeling and web development, allowing users to explore different 3D models and animations through an interactive web interface. The application leverages the power of WebGL to render high-quality 3D graphics directly in the browser, providing an immersive experience for visitors.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can navigate through different projects using the menu. Each project features interactive 3D models that you can manipulate with your mouse. You can rotate, zoom, and explore the models in detail.

## Features
- **3D Visualizations**: Displays a variety of 3D models and scenes created using Three.js.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with different projects and 3D elements.
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Projects can be dynamically loaded and displayed based on user selection.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It simplifies the process of rendering complex 3D scenes and models.
- **OpenGL**: The underlying graphics API used by Three.js for rendering 3D graphics, providing high performance and flexibility.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components that enhance the interactivity of the portfolio.
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language used to implement the functionality of the application, including event handling and model manipulation.
- **3D Models**: Various 3D models are used in the portfolio, showcasing different projects. These models are created using tools like Blender or imported from online repositories.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Introduce more interactive features, such as animations triggered by user actions.
- **SEO Optimization**: Implement SEO best practices to improve visibility in search engines.
- **Additional Projects**: Continuously add new projects to showcase more of my work.
